# TODO
- Get a copy of killed binaries
- are there any easily-hookable calls that reliably id UPX, pyinstaler, common offensive tooling?
- ability to whitelist files by path, hash, ...
- CLI flags to enable/disable features
  - verbose output
  - whitelisted binaries
  - alert rather than kill
  - hide module?
- squelch the tainted kernel message
